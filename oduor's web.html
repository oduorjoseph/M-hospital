Web programming refers to the writing, markup and coding involved in Web development, which includes Web content, Web client and server scripting and network security.
<br> The most common languages used for Web programming are XML, HTML, JavaScript, Perl 5 and PHP. Web programming is different from just programming, which requires interdisciplinary knowledge on the application area, client and server scripting, and database technology.</p>
<h2 style="color: blue; font-family:georgian; font-size:40px; font-style: italic;">Types of Web Development</h2>
<p style="font-size:20px; color: yellow;">
1.	Front-end Development
Involves development of the user interface of the website, through the use of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so that users can view and interact with that website. The front end is commonly referred to as the client side, or more broadly speaking, the user interface. While many people use front end to describe website-related development, it can refer to any software that a user interacts with. 
<br>2.	Back-end Development
Back end development refers to the server side of an application and everything that communicates between the database and the browser.  It focuses on how the site works, making updates and changes in addition to monitoring functionality of the site.
<br>3.	Full Stack Development
It refers to the development of both front end (client side) and back end(server side) portions of web application
<br>4.	Website Development
Website development refers to the work that goes into building a website. This could apply to anything from creating a single plain-text webpage to developing a complex web application or social network.
<br>5.	Desktop Development
Involves development/creation of desktop applications that run as stand alone in a desktop or laptop computer; this contrasts with Web-based application, which requires the Web browser to run.
<br>6.	Mobile Development
It is the process of creating software applications that run on a mobile device, and a typical mobile application utilizes a network connection to work with remote computing resources.
<br>7.	Game Development
Game Development is the art of creating games and describes the design, development and release of a game. It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release
<br>8.	Embedded Development
It is development of computer software, written to control machines or devices that are not typically thought of as computers, commonly known as embedded systems. It is typically specialized for the particular hardware that it runs on and has time and memory constraints
<br>9.	Security Development
It involves development of custom software that incorporates security measures throughout the development process.  It ensures that software satisfies the unique requirements of an organization for flawless performance with minimal security risks.

The Entity-Relationship (ER) model is a conceptual data model that views the real world as entities and relationships.
 A basic component of the model is the Entity-Relationship diagram which is used to visually represent data objects.
 Today, ER model is commonly used for database design. For the database designer, the utility of the ER model is: 
 
a.	It maps well to the relational model. The constructs used in the ER model can easily be transformed into relational tables. 
b.	It is simple and easy to understand with a minimum of training.
    Therefore, the model can be used by the database designer to communicate the design to the end user. 
c.	In addition, the model can be used as a design plan by the database developer to implement a data model in specific database management software. 
 
<br> It may involve concept generation, design, build, test and release.</p>
<h4 style="color:blue; font-size:40px; font-style: italic; ">Website Development tools</h4>

<p style="font-size:20px; color: yellow;">
Entities are classified as independent or dependent (in some methodologies, the terms used are strong and weak, respectively).
 An independent entity is one that does not rely on another for identification. 
 A dependent entity is one that relies on another for identification. The following terms are used with entity: 
 
a.	Entity Occurrence: An entity occurrence (also called an instance) is an individual occurrence of an entity. 
    An occurrence is analogous to a row in the relational table.  
    An instance of an entity is like a specific example: 
    Bill Gates is an Employee of Microsoft 
    SPAM is a Product 
    Greenpeace is an Organization 
    Flour is an ingredient 
 
b.	Associative entities (also known as intersection entities) are entities used to associate two or more entities in order to reconcile a many-to-many relationship. 
 
c.	Subtypes entities are used in generalization hierarchies to represent a subset of instances of their parent entity, called the supertype, but which have attributes or relationships that apply only to the subset. 

There are numerous web development tools; they are majorly classified as front- end or back-end. 
The following are common tools used in web developmebt
<br>•	Front end - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, jQuery, Git, visual studio, Typescript etc
<br>•	Backend – PHP, Python, Javascript, Django, MySQL etc
</p>
<p style="font-size:20px; color: yellow;">
<br>Relationships are classified by their degree, connectivity, cardinality, direction, type, and existence. 
<br>Not all modeling methodologies use all these classifications. 
 
 <br>(a) Degree of a Relationship: The degree of a relationship is the number of entities associated with the relationship. 
 <br>The n-ary relationship is the general form for degree n. 
<br>Special cases are the binary, and ternary, where the degree is 2, and 3, respectively. 
<br>Binary relationships, the association between two entities, are the most common type in the real world. 
<br>A recursive binary relationship occurs when an entity is related to itself. 
<br>An example might be "some employees are married to other employees". 
 
<br>A ternary relationship involves three entities and is used when a binary relationship is inadequate.
 <br>Many modeling approaches recognize only binary relationships. 
 <br>Ternary or n-ary relationships are decomposed into two or more binary relationships. 
 
<br>(b) Connectivity and Cardinality 
 
<br>The connectivity of a relationship describes the mapping of associated entity instances in the relationship. 
<br>The values of connectivity are "one" or "many".
 <br>The cardinality of a relationship is the actual number of related occurrences for each of the two entities. 
 <br>The basic types of connectivity for relations are: one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to- many. 
 
<br>i.	A one-to-one (1:1) relationship is when at most one instance of a entity A is associated with one instance of entity B.
 <br>For example, "employees in the company are each assigned their own office. 
 <br>For each employee there exists a unique office and for each office there exists a unique employee. 
<br>ii.A one-to-many (1:N) relationships is when for one instance of entity A, there are zero, one, or many instances of entity B, but for one instance of entity B, there is only one instance of entity A. 
<br>An example of a 1:N relationships is 
 
a department has many employees 
 
 
each employee is assigned to one department 
 
 
<br>iii. A many-to-many (M:N) relationship, sometimes called non-specific, is when for one instance of entity A, there are zero, one, or many instances of entity B and for one instance of entity B there are zero, one, or many instances of entity A. 
<br>An example is: 
 
employees can be assigned to no more than two projects at the same time; 
 
 
projects must have assigned at least three employees 
 
 
<br>A single employee can be assigned to many projects; conversely, a single project can have assigned to it many employee. 
<br>Here the cardinality for the relationship between employees and projects is two and the cardinality between project and employee is three.
<br>Many-to-many relationships cannot be directly translated to relational tables but instead must be transformed into two or more one-to-many relationships using associative entities. 
(c)	Direction 
 
<br>The direction of a relationship indicates the originating entity of a binary relationship.
<br>The entity from which a relationship originates is the parent entity; the entity where the relationship terminates is the child entity. 
 
<br>The direction of a relationship is determined by its connectivity.
<br>In a one-to-one relationship the direction is from the independent entity to a dependent entity. If both entities are independent, the direction is arbitrary.
<br>With one-to-many relationships, the entity occurring once is the parent. The direction of many-to-many relationships is arbitrary. 
 
<br>(d)	Type 
 
<br>An identifying relationship is one in which one of the child entities is also a dependent entity. A non-identifying relationship is one in which both entities are independent. 
 
<br>(e)	Existence 
 
<br>Existence denotes whether the existence of an entity instance is dependent upon the existence of another, related, entity instance. 
<br>The existence of an entity in a relationship is defined as either mandatory or optional. 
<br>If an instance of an entity must always occur for an entity to be included in a relationship, then it is mandatory. 
<br>An example of mandatory existence is the statement "every project must be managed by a single department". 
<br>If the instance of the entity is not required, it is optional. An example of optional existence is the statement, "employees may be assigned to work on projects".

<p style="font-size:20px; color: yellow;">
The BMW Concept X6 ActiveHybrid is the concept vehicle of BMWs first full-hybrid vehicle and was revealed at the Internationale Automobil-Ausstellung Frankfurt in September 2007.
<br>[1][12] BMWs first mild-hybrid BMW Concept 7 Series ActiveHybrid Generation 1 was revealed at the Paris Motor Show in October 2008. 
<br>Both cars made their market debuts at the end of 2009[13] and the X6 Hybrid can drive in pure electrical mode at low speeds.
<br> The Active Hybrid 7 Generation 1 does not have this ability.
The BMW Concept X6 ActiveHybrid uses the V8 Twin Turbo with High Precision Injection that powers the BMW X6 xDrive50i.
A defining feature of the BMW Concept X6 ActiveHybrid is its Two-Mode active transmission, an innovative technology that controls the interplay of the electrical motors and the internal combustion engine.
<br> The car can operate in two modes: mode 1 delivers high torque when pulling away from a standing start and at low speeds, while mode 2 is suited for higher speeds. 
<br>The result is that the car always uses the available power resources in the most efficient possible way, whatever speed it is travelling at.
The ActiveHybrid X6 made its world premiere at the Frankfurt Motor Show (IAA) in September 2009.
In late 2009, BMW introduced an X6 featuring a version of the Global Hybrid Cooperation hybrid vehicle drivetrain, popularly known as the two-mode hybrid system.
<br>[14] This car was confirmed as being called the BMW ActiveHybrid X6, and it is the world's most powerful hybrid vehicle; it is not sold in the UK.
<br>[15] The production vehicle was unveiled alongside a 7 Series hybrid at the 2009 Frankfurt Motor Show.
<br> The ActiveHybrid X6 went on sale in December 2009 in the US market with a base price of US$89,765.[16]
The drive system featured in the BMW ActiveHybrid X6 consists of a 300 kW (402 hp) V8 power unit with BMW TwinPower Turbo Technology and two electric engines developing 67 kW (90 hp) and, respectively, 63 kW (84 hp). 
<br>Maximum system output is 357 kW (479 hp) and peak torque is 780 N⋅m (575 lbf⋅ft).
   BMW ActiveHybrid technology offers the driver three significant options: to drive under electric power alone, to use the power of the combustion engine, or to benefit from the combination of both drive modes for short periods of maximum acceleration, using the 485 hp (362 kW) maximum.
<br> Driving completely free of CO2 in the electric mode is possible up to a speed of 37 mph (60 km/h).
<br> The hybrid also employs stop-start technology and other energy saving measures to help improve efficiency.
<br> The core-vehicle is however very heavy and the petrol power unit limits the extent to which fuel consumption can be reduced in absolute terms. 
<br>The Turbo-Diesel models in the X6 range use less fuel.
